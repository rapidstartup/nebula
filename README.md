## 🚀 **Vision**

Nebula exists to **return democratic power to its rightful place: in the hands of the people**. We believe that technology should serve humanity, not control it, and that true democracy requires tools that are transparent, inclusive, and impossible to corrupt or silence.

Our platform bridges the gap between individual agency and collective action, enabling spontaneous community organization and decision-making that is resistant to censorship and centralized control.
