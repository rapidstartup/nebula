Product Requirements Document: Nebula
Version: 1.0
Date: June 22, 2025
Author: [Your Name/Team]
Status: Draft

1. Introduction & Overview
Nebula is a decentralized application designed to fundamentally reshape democratic participation. It serves as an all-in-one platform for self-sovereign identity, spontaneous community governance through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and transparent consensus-building. Inspired by David Shapiro's vision and the success of direct democracy models like the Swiss cantons, Nebula aims to provide citizens with the tools to consolidate real political power within their geographic regions. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform will be secure, transparent, and "unstoppable"—resistant to censorship and centralized control. The initial version will focus on providing a seamless, intuitive experience, making complex governance concepts as accessible as a modern banking app.
2. The Problem
The current social contract often features a significant disconnect between citizens and the levers of power. Traditional governance models can be opaque, slow-moving, and susceptible to centralized influence, leaving citizens feeling disempowered. There is a "fundamental missing piece" in modern democracy: a direct, transparent, and incorruptible mechanism for communities to:
Surface True Consensus: Opinion polling is often flawed, and community sentiment is hard to quantify and act upon.
Organize Effectively: Forming a legal entity to manage community projects or funds is fraught with bureaucracy and cost.
Exercise Direct Power: Citizens lack a practical tool to collectively manage public funds, make binding decisions, or hold representatives accountable in real-time.
Resist Centralization: Centralized platforms can be censored, manipulated, or shut down, making them unreliable for true civic action.
Nebula addresses this by providing a decentralized infrastructure for direct democracy.
3. Goals & Objectives
The success of Nebula will be measured by its ability to foster genuine civic engagement and demonstrate a viable alternative to traditional governance.
Goal
Key Result (Success Metric)
Empower Direct Governance
Achieve 10,000 monthly active users within the pilot region (e.g., a Swiss canton) within 12 months of launch.
Facilitate Spontaneous Organization
Users can create a new, geo-fenced DAO and initiate its first proposal in under 10 minutes.
Ensure Platform Resilience
Achieve 99.95% uptime and demonstrate architectural resistance to simulated censorship or state-level takedown attempts.
Foster Transparent Consensus
Over 50% of active users participate in at least one poll or proposal vote per month.
Build a Scalable Model
Successfully document the pilot's legal and operational framework to create a blueprint for expansion into a second region.

4. Target Audience & User Personas
The primary user is any citizen within a defined geographic area who wishes to have a more direct say in their community's governance.
Persona 1: Anna, The Engaged Citizen (Zurich, Switzerland)
Bio: 35-year-old urban planner. Already votes in federal referendums but feels local issues are managed opaquely. Tech-savvy and familiar with digital banking.
Needs: A transparent way to see how local funds are allocated for projects like parks and public transport. Wants to propose and vote on specific neighborhood initiatives. Values security and data privacy above all.
Frustrations: The slow pace of municipal government and the lack of a direct feedback loop.


Persona 2: Ben, The Community Organizer (Austin, USA)
Bio: 45-year-old small business owner. Frustrated with city council bureaucracy when trying to get a permit for a community garden.
Needs: A tool to quickly rally his neighbors, pool funds securely, and create a formal proposal to present to the city, backed by verifiable community consensus.
Frustrations: The "red tape" and difficulty in proving that his initiative has broad community support.


Persona 3: Maria, The Curious but Cautious User
Bio: 22-year-old university student. Hears about crypto and DAOs but finds it intimidating and complex.
Needs: An extremely simple, guided onboarding process that explains concepts clearly. She needs to trust the platform is secure and won't require deep technical knowledge to use.
Frustrations: The jargon-filled world of Web3 and the fear of making a costly mistake.


5. Website Design & User Experience
The public-facing website will serve as the primary entry point for new users, explaining the vision and guiding them to the app.
Overall Theme: "Cosmic Democracy." The design will use a dark mode default to evoke the vastness and interconnectedness of the universe. The aesthetic is clean, futuristic, and hopeful, not dystopian.
Palette: Deep space blues, purples, and blacks, with bright, nebula-like accent colors (e.g., magenta, cyan, gold) for CTAs and highlights.
Typography: A clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Satoshi) for readability and a futuristic feel.
Page 1: Home
Hero Section:
Visual: A full-screen, slowly animated nebula in the background. The animation is subtle—gases swirl gently, and distant stars occasionally twinkle. It should not be resource-intensive or distracting.
Tagline (centered, large font): Nebula: Governed by the People. Powered by the Cosmos.
Sub-headline: The all-in-one app for direct democracy, community action, and self-sovereign identity.
CTA Button: A brightly colored, glowing button: Enter the App or Join the Pilot.


How It Works Section:
A simple 3-step visual guide with icons:
Verify Identity: "Securely confirm you're you."
Join Your DAO: "Connect with your local community."
Vote & Propose: "Shape your future, together."

6. Functional Requirements (MVP V1.0)
Epic 1: Identity & Onboarding
User Story 1.1: As a new user (Maria), I want a simple, step-by-step onboarding process so that I can create my account and understand the basics without feeling overwhelmed.
User Story 1.2: As a citizen (Anna), I want to create a self-sovereign digital identity that I alone control, ensuring my data is private and secure.
User Story 1.3: As a user wanting to join a local DAO, I must complete a secure, privacy-preserving verification of my geographic residency to ensure fair and legitimate participation.
Epic 2: DAO Formation & Management
User Story 2.1: As a community organizer (Ben), I want an intuitive interface to create a new DAO for my neighborhood, defining its name, geographic boundaries, and mission.
User Story 2.2: As a DAO founder, I want to set the initial governance rules, such as the percentage of votes (quorum) needed to pass a proposal.
User Story 2.3: As a resident (Anna), I want to easily browse and find the official DAO for my geographic area and request to join it.
Epic 3: Governance & Voting
User Story 3.1: As a DAO member, I want to create a new proposal on a specific issue, with a clear description and a simple Agree/Disagree polling option.
User Story 3.2: As a DAO member, I want to see a list of active proposals and cast my vote on them securely and transparently.
User Story 3.3: As any user, I want to see the real-time results of a poll as votes are cast to understand emerging consensus.
User Story 3.4: As a proposal creator, I want the ability to allow other members to suggest alternative choices for a poll, which I can then approve to add to the ballot.
Epic 4: Transparency & Information
User Story 4.1: As a DAO member (Anna), I want to view a public ledger of our DAO's treasury, showing all incoming funds and every expenditure approved by a vote.
User Story 4.2: As a member, I want to access a simple, wiki-style knowledge base for my DAO to collaboratively document rules, past decisions, and important information.
User Story 4.3: As a wiki contributor, I want a system where edits or new sentences can be voted on by the community to ensure the information is accurate and reflects group consensus.
7. Non-Functional Requirements
Security: The system must be built with end-to-end encryption. All smart contracts will undergo rigorous third-party audits before deployment. The architecture must be maximally decentralized to mitigate single points of failure or control, learning from the challenges faced by platforms like Tornado Cash.
Usability: The UI/UX must be exceptionally clean and intuitive. All jargon will be abstracted away or explained in simple tooltips. The target is to be "as simple to use as Venmo or a modern banking app."
Performance: All user-facing interactions, especially voting and viewing results, must feel instantaneous with minimal latency.
Scalability: While the pilot is geographically focused, the underlying architecture must be designed to eventually support millions of users across thousands of DAOs.
Interoperability: Users should be able to connect their preferred third-party wallets, but the app should also provide a simple, embedded wallet solution for newcomers.
8. Future Scope / V2.0 Features
Prediction Markets: Integrate paid polls to allow for more sophisticated forecasting on the outcomes of proposals or external events.
AI Agent Integration: Explore the use of self-assembling AI agents to automate DAO management, analyze proposals for potential impacts, or summarize complex discussions.
Cross-Platform Integration: Develop APIs or plugins to allow DAOs to interface with social platforms like X or Bluesky for broader communication.
Delegated Voting: Allow users to delegate their voting power to a trusted expert or representative on specific topics.
Fiat On-Ramps: Integrate secure services for users to contribute to DAO treasuries using traditional currency.
9. Out of Scope for V1.0
Full Crypto Exchange: Nebula will not be a platform for trading cryptocurrencies.
Non-Geographic DAOs: The initial focus is exclusively on DAOs tied to real-world geography (cities, counties, etc.).
Advanced Smart Contract Creation: The V1 interface will use templates for DAO creation; it will not include a tool for writing custom smart contracts from scratch.
10. Assumptions & Dependencies
Legal Feasibility: Assumes that operating such a platform is legally permissible within the pilot jurisdiction (Switzerland). A legal framework will need to be established.
Identity Verification: Dependent on the availability of a third-party service that can perform geographic and identity verification in a secure and privacy-preserving manner.
User Adoption: Assumes a sufficient number of citizens in the pilot region are willing to engage with a new digital platform for civic action.
