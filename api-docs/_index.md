# Nebula API Documentation

v.1.0

Welcome to the Nebula API documentation. This API allows developers to interact with the Nebula platform, enabling integration with various applications and services.

## Overview

The Nebula API is designed to provide access to the core functionalities of the Nebula platform, including:

*   **Identity Management**: Manage user identities, authentication, and profiles.
*   **DAO Management**: Create, manage, discover, and join Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).
*   **Governance**: Participate in proposals, voting, and view results.
*   **Treasury Management**: Interact with DAO treasuries and manage financial transactions.
*   **Wiki Management**: Manage DAO-specific knowledge bases.

Our API is built on REST principles, using standard HTTP methods and returning JSON-formatted responses.

## Getting Started

To start using the Nebula API, you will need to familiarize yourself with the available endpoints and authentication methods.

### Authentication

*(Details on authentication mechanisms will be provided here. This may include API keys, OAuth tokens, or other methods. Placeholder for now.)*

All API requests must be authenticated. Unauthenticated requests will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.

### Base URL

All API URLs referenced in this documentation start with the following base URL:

`https://api.nebula.rapidstartup.io/v1`

*(Note: This is a placeholder URL and may change.)*

### Rate Limiting

*(Details on API rate limits will be provided here. Placeholder for now.)*

To ensure fair usage and stability of the platform, API requests are subject to rate limiting. If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

### Error Handling

The Nebula API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

*   `2xx` codes indicate success.
*   `4xx` codes indicate a client-side error (e.g., invalid parameters, authentication failure).
*   `5xx` codes indicate a server-side error.

Error responses will typically include a JSON body with more details about the error:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "A human-readable error message."
  }
}
```

## API Versioning

The current version of the API is `v1`. We strive to maintain backward compatibility, but if breaking changes are necessary, they will be introduced in a new API version.

## Data Models / Schemas

Many API endpoints utilize common data structures for requests and responses. These are documented in detail in the [Data Models](./data-models.md) section. Understanding these models will be helpful when working with the API.

## Support

If you have any questions or need assistance, please refer to our [Developer Resources](https://rapidstartup.gitbook.io/nebula/) or contact our support team. *(Link to support channel to be added)*.
