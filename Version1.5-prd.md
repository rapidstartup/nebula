### **1. Introduction & Overview**
_(No change from v1.0)_
Nebula is a decentralized application designed to fundamentally reshape democratic participation. It serves as an all-in-one platform for self-sovereign identity, spontaneous community governance through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and transparent consensus-building...

### **2. The Problem**
_(No change from v1.0)_
The current social contract often features a significant disconnect between citizens and the levers of power...

### **3. Goals & Objectives**
_(No change from v1.0)_

### **4. Target Audience & User Personas**
_(No change from v1.0)_

### **5. Website Design & User Experience**
_(No change from v1.0)_

### **6. Functional Requirements (MVP V1.0)**

#### **Epic 1: Identity & Onboarding**
*   **User Story 1.1:** As a new user (Maria), I want a simple, step-by-step onboarding process so that I can create my account and understand the basics without feeling overwhelmed.
*   **User Story 1.2 (Revised):** As a citizen (Anna), I want to create a **Sybil-resistant, provably unique** self-sovereign digital identity that I alone control. The system must prevent a single individual from creating multiple voting-eligible accounts. *Reference models include biocryptic systems (e.g., Cicada's HUID) or integration with state-verified digital IDs.*
*   **User Story 1.3:** As a user wanting to join a local DAO, I must complete a secure, privacy-preserving verification of my geographic residency to ensure fair and legitimate participation.
*   **User Story 1.4 (New):** As a user, I want an "Info Wallet" where I control my Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and can grant revocable, role-based access to my data for specific services or DAOs without exposing all my information.

#### **Epic 2: DAO Formation & Management**
_(No change from v1.0)_

#### **Epic 3: Governance & Voting**
_(No change from v1.0)_

#### **Epic 4: Transparency & Information**
_(No change from v1.0)_

#### **6.5 Economic Model (New Section)**
The platform must distinguish between monetary transactions and core governance actions. To ensure universal access and prevent participation from being throttled by market volatility, core democratic functions must not incur fluctuating, monetary "gas" fees. The system will implement a mechanism, such as a self-replenishing **"Action Token"** system, to facilitate actions like voting, creating proposals, and joining a local DAO for free. Monetary transactions (e.g., funding a DAO treasury) will be handled separately.

### **7. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Security:**
    *   The system must be built with end-to-end encryption. All smart contracts will undergo rigorous third-party audits before deployment. The architecture must be maximally decentralized to mitigate single points of failure or control.
    *   **Client Integrity (New):** The client application must be verifiable. It should be able to check its own binaries against a trusted, decentralized registry (e.g., a software blockchain) upon startup to ensure the code has not been tampered with or compromised by malware.
*   **Usability:** The UI/UX must be exceptionally clean and intuitive. All jargon will be abstracted away or explained in simple tooltips. The target is to be "as simple to use as Venmo or a modern banking app."
*   **Performance:** All user-facing interactions, especially voting and viewing results, must feel instantaneous with minimal latency.
*   **Scalability:** While the pilot is geographically focused, the underlying architecture must be designed to eventually support millions of users across thousands of DAOs.
*   **Resilience (New):**
    *   **Mesh Network Capability:** The platform should be designed with the long-term goal of operating on a decentralized peer-to-peer mesh network, ensuring functionality even in the absence of traditional internet infrastructure. This is critical to the "unstoppable" mandate.
*   **Interoperability:** Users should be able to connect their preferred third-party wallets, but the app should also provide a simple, embedded wallet solution for newcomers.

### **8. Future Scope / V2.0 Features**

*   **Prediction Markets**
*   **Fiat On-Ramps**
*   **Advanced Governance Suite (V2+) (New Section):**
    *   **Proposal Filtration:** Implement a graduated filtration system for citizen proposals to manage scale and prevent voter fatigue. A new proposal might be shown to 100 random users, and only if it passes a consensus threshold does it advance to a group of 1,000, and so on.
    *   **Automated Voting Assistance:** Develop an optional, AI-driven system to help users manage voting by learning their preferences over time. This could provide recommendations or auto-vote on non-critical issues, always with a manual override and full auditability.
    *   **Advanced Incentives:** Develop a rewards system (e.g., gamification, lotteries) that incentivizes long-term, constructive participation and platform security, rather than rewarding individual votes which could be subverted.

## **Supporting Documentation Plan**

To ensure the successful, ethical, and legally sound development of Nebula, the core implementation team will create the following set of essential documents. This plan provides an abstract and background for each to guide their creation.

### **1. Project Charter**
*   **Abstract:** The Project Charter is the high-level "North Star" document for Nebula. It formally authorizes the project and outlines its mission, vision, and core objectives. It will define the project's scope, identify key stakeholders (from core developers to pilot community members), list high-level deliverables, and establish the primary success criteria.
*   **Background & Purpose:** In a project as ambitious as Nebula, alignment is everything. This document serves as the single source of truth to prevent scope creep and ensure that all participants—investors, developers, partners, and the community—share a common understanding of the project's goals and boundaries. It is the project's constitution.

### **2. Proof of Personhood Whitepaper**
*   **Abstract:** This technical whitepaper will provide a detailed, in-depth exploration of Nebula's chosen solution for Sybil resistance. It will analyze various "Proof of Personhood" models, justify the selected approach (e.g., biocryptics, state-ID integration, social vouching), and describe the cryptographic and security architecture. It will cover the enrollment process, key management, the "Info Wallet" design, and mitigations for known attack vectors (e.g., coercion, hardware compromise).
*   **Background & Purpose:** The PRD states *what* is needed (Sybil resistance), but this whitepaper explains *how* it will be achieved and *why* that method is superior. The legitimacy and security of the entire platform rest on solving this problem correctly. This document will be the cornerstone for security audits and for building trust with technically-minded community members. It must demonstrate the same level of rigor as the Cicada HUID proposal.

### **3. Philosophy & Guiding Principles**
*   **Abstract:** A document outlining the core ethos and unwavering principles of the Nebula project. It will codify foundational beliefs such as radical decentralization, user sovereignty over data and identity, censorship resistance, open-source transparency, and political agnosticism. It will serve as the ethical compass for the project.
*   **Background & Purpose:** The PRD can't cover every possible edge case. When the team faces a difficult design choice (e.g., "Do we make this feature slightly more convenient but add a point of centralization?"), this document provides the framework for making the right decision. It defines the "soul" of the project and ensures the technology remains true to the original vision of empowering people, not controlling them.

### **4. Terms of Service (ToS)**
*   **Abstract:** The formal legal agreement between the Nebula platform/foundation and its users. This document will define user rights and responsibilities, limitations of liability, intellectual property rights for the platform itself, and the process for updates. It will clearly delineate the responsibilities of the core entity from the autonomous actions of the DAOs operating on the platform.
*   **Background & Purpose:** While Nebula is decentralized, a legal entity will likely exist to steward initial development. The ToS is a legal necessity to manage this relationship. The key challenge will be crafting terms that are enforceable while respecting the decentralized and user-sovereign nature of the platform. It must be written in plain language to be accessible to all users.

### **5. Privacy Policy**
*   **Abstract:** A comprehensive and transparent explanation of all data interactions on the Nebula platform. It will explicitly state what data (if any) is collected during identity verification, how it is processed, if it is stored (and for how long), and with whom it might be shared. It will detail the user's rights to access, amend, and revoke access to their data, directly reflecting the functionality of the "Info Wallet."
*   **Background & Purpose:** For a platform built on identity, trust is paramount. This policy must be radically transparent and user-centric. It's not just a legal checkbox; it's a core feature of the product. It must clearly explain how Nebula's architecture is designed from the ground up to minimize data collection and maximize user privacy, setting it apart from traditional Web2 platforms.

### **6. Ethics & Code of Conduct**
*   **Abstract:** This document establishes the social contract for the Nebula ecosystem. It will define acceptable and unacceptable behavior, including standards against harassment, spamming the proposal system, creating fraudulent DAOs, and attempts to manipulate governance. It will also outline the proposed framework for community-led moderation, dispute resolution, and enforcement within a decentralized context.
*   **Background & Purpose:** A governance tool is inherently a social tool. Without a clear code of conduct, these platforms can become toxic and unusable. For a decentralized system, the challenge is defining *how* this code is enforced without a central administrator. This document will explore those mechanisms, such as reputation systems, DAO-level moderation rules, and a transparent process for addressing violations, ensuring the platform remains a safe and productive space for civic discourse.
