## Tweet 1 (Hook)
🌌 What if democratic governance wasn't broken?

What if communities could make decisions together—transparently, securely, without bureaucracy or corruption?

Today we're launching Nebula: cosmic-powered democratic governance for the real world.

Thread 🧵👇

---

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Democracy is failing:

❌ Citizens feel disconnected from decisions
❌ Bureaucracy kills community initiatives  
❌ Centralized systems = corruption & censorship risk
❌ Young people checked out of politics entirely

We need tools built for the 21st century, not the 18th.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Solution)
Nebula bridges the gap:

✅ Geographic DAOs—communities organized by location
✅ Proof of Personhood—one person, one vote (no whales)
✅ Mobile-first—governance that fits in your pocket
✅ Self-sovereign identity—you own your data

Built for communities, not just crypto degens.

---

## Tweet 4 (How It Works)
3 steps to participate:

1️⃣ Connect your wallet (MetaMask, mobile wallets)
2️⃣ Verify your identity (biocryptic, not invasive KYC)
3️⃣ Join a DAO, create proposals, vote

That's it. No 47-step onboarding. No PhD required.

## Tweet 5 (Tech Stack)
What's under the hood?

🔹 Smart contracts on Sepolia testnet
🔹 React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
🔹 wagmi/viem for Web3 interactions
🔹 WalletConnect for mobile support
🔹 Open source & decentralized

Built by @LifeOnAutoSite & @DaveShapi with cosmic ambition.

## Tweet 6 (Use Cases)
Who is Nebula for?

🏛️ Swiss municipalities (pilot program launching)
🏘️ Housing cooperatives & HOAs
🌱 Climate action groups
🎓 University student governments
🏢 Worker cooperatives

Any community that wants real democracy.

## Tweet 7 (Differentiation)
How is Nebula different from Snapshot/Tally/Aragon?

Most governance tools are built for crypto protocols.

Nebula is built for real people.

✅ No token required
✅ Mobile-native experience
✅ Geographic organization
✅ Proof of Personhood (not plutocracy)

## Tweet 8 (The Swiss Connection)
Why Switzerland?

🇨🇭 Direct democracy culture (referendums are normal)
🇨🇭 Digital infrastructure ready
🇨🇭 Crypto-friendly regulation
🇨🇭 Principle of subsidiarity—local decisions for local people

Target: 10,000+ monthly active users in 12 months.

## Tweet 9 (Call to Action)
We need:

🤝 Pilot partners (municipalities, communities)
🔨 Developers (React, Solidity, Web3)
📢 Advocates (share this thread!)
💡 Advisors (governance, democratic innovation)

Reply or DM @LifeOnAutoSite if you want to build the future of democracy.
