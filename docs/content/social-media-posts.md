### Post 1: The Problem (Monday)

**Heading:** Most DAOs aren't actually democratic. Here's why that matters.

**Body:**
I've been working on something that I believe could change how communities make decisions.

The current state of DAO governance is broken. Token-weighted voting means one dollar = one vote. That's not democracy—it's plutocracy.

If you have 1,000,000 tokens, you get 1,000,000 votes.
If you have 1 token, you get 1 vote.

This excludes:
• Communities that value equal representation
• Non-crypto native participants
• Anyone who believes in "one person, one vote"
• Organizations that need verified membership

We're building Nebula to fix this.

Nebula is governance infrastructure that enables:
✓ One-person-one-vote (with identity verification)
✓ Geographic communities (not just token holders)
✓ Mobile-first experience (vote in 10 seconds)
✓ Gasless transactions (no fees to participate)
✓ Swiss eID integration (government-grade identity)

Currently on testnet and seeking pilot partners: HOAs, cooperatives, municipalities, and community DAOs.

If you believe democracy should be accessible to everyone—not just the wealthy—let's talk.

### Post 2: The Solution (Wednesday)

**Heading:** We just made creating a DAO as easy as setting up a Facebook group.

**Body:**
5 minutes. That's all it takes to launch a democratic organization with Nebula.

No coding.
No gas fees.
No token economics PhD required.

Here's what you can do in 5 minutes:

1️⃣ Create your DAO
Give it a name, set your location, define your voting rules.

2️⃣ Invite members
They verify their identity (privacy-preserving), join your community.

3️⃣ Start governing
Submit proposals, vote, manage treasury—all from your phone.

Real use cases we're seeing:
🏘️ HOAs voting on maintenance budgets
🌾 Cooperatives electing boards
🏛️ Municipalities consulting citizens
🤝 Communities managing shared treasuries

The kicker? It's designed for people who've never used crypto.

Your grandmother could vote on a community proposal with Nebula. That's the point.

Currently live on Sepolia testnet. Mainnet launch Q2 2026.

Looking for pilot partners—DM me if your organization needs better governance tools.

### Post 3: Swiss Angle (Friday)

**Heading:** Switzerland could become the global model for digital democracy.

**Body:**
Switzerland has three things that make it perfect for digital democracy innovation:

1️⃣ Direct democracy is already in the culture
Swiss citizens vote on everything—laws, budgets, constitutional amendments. They're politically engaged and expect to have a voice.

2️⃣ Digital infrastructure is world-class
Near-universal internet penetration, high smartphone adoption, strong data protection laws.

3️⃣ Willingness to innovate
"Crypto Valley" (Zug) has been embracing blockchain for years. The country is open to technological experiments in governance.

We're building Nebula specifically for Swiss-style democracy:
• Swiss eID native integration
• Multi-language (DE/FR/IT/EN)
• Geographic DAO boundaries (municipalities, cantons)
• Principle of subsidiarity built in
• Privacy-first by design

Our goal: 3-5 Swiss municipality pilots in 2026.

If you work in Swiss municipal government, digital innovation, or civic tech—I'd love to connect.

The future of democracy is decentralized. Switzerland could lead the way.

### Post 4: Grant News (When applicable)

**Heading:** We just applied for $150K from the Ethereum Foundation

**Body:**
Big news: Nebula has submitted a grant application to the Ethereum Foundation ESP program.

What we're building:
Democratic governance infrastructure that doesn't require crypto knowledge and doesn't favor wealthy token holders.

The grant would fund:
• Smart contract security audit
• Swiss eID integration
• 3-5 municipality pilot programs
• Complete open-source documentation

Why this matters:
If approved, it validates that democratic governance tools are critical public goods for the Web3 ecosystem.

The Ethereum Foundation has funded game-changing projects before:
• Uniswap
• Optimism
• Gitcoin

We're hoping to join that list—not for the funding (though that helps), but for the credibility and community that comes with it.

Fingers crossed. 🤞

Either way, we're building this. The grant would just accelerate it.

## Twitter/X Posts

### Thread 1: Why Token Voting Is Broken (Post as thread)

**Tweet 1/5:**
Most DAOs use token-weighted voting.

Sounds fair, right? 

Wrong. 🧵

**Tweet 2/5:**
Token voting = plutocracy

• 1M tokens = 1M votes
• 1 token = 1 vote

The wealthy control everything.

That's not democracy.

**Tweet 3/5:**
What gets excluded:
• Communities that value equal votes
• Non-crypto participants
• Democratic organizations (co-ops, HOAs)
• Anyone who can't afford tokens

**Tweet 4/5:**
The alternative:

1-person-1-vote with identity verification.

✅ Privacy-preserving
✅ Sybil-resistant
✅ Actually democratic
✅ Mobile-first

**Tweet 5/5:**
We're building @nebuladao to enable this.

Geographic communities.
Verified members.
Gasless voting.

Real democracy, finally.

### Tweet 2: Quick Value Prop

Token voting = rich people control everything

Nebula = one person, one vote

If you believe in actual democracy, you should be paying attention to what we're building.

## Reddit Posts

### r/DAO Post

**Title:** I built a DAO tool that doesn't use token-weighted voting. Here's why.

**Body:**
Hey r/DAO,

I've been frustrated with the state of DAO governance. Token-weighted voting is plutocracy masquerading as democracy.

So I built something different.

**Nebula** is a governance platform with:
• One-person-one-vote (identity verified)
• Geographic boundaries (HOAs, municipalities)
• Gasless voting (no transaction fees)
• Mobile-first (works on any phone)
• Swiss eID integration (for official use)

**Why this matters:**
Not every community wants token-weighted governance. HOAs, cooperatives, municipalities—they need equal representation, not whale dominance.

**Current status:**
Live on Sepolia testnet. Smart contracts deployed. Frontend complete.

**What I need:**
Pilot partners to test this with real communities. Looking for:
• HOAs
• Cooperatives
• Municipalities (especially Swiss!)
• Community DAOs

**The code:**
Open source (MIT license): github.com/rapidstartup/nebula

Would love your feedback. What governance features are missing from current tools?

### r/ethereum Post

**Title:** Show Reddit: I built a governance platform for communities that hate token-weighted voting

**Body:**
Hey r/ethereum,

Most DAO tooling assumes you want token-weighted voting. But what if you're:
• An HOA that wants equal homeowner votes?
• A cooperative following Rochdale Principles?
• A municipality needing verified residents?

I built Nebula for these use cases.

**Core features:**
✓ Self-sovereign identity (proof of personhood)
✓ Gasless off-chain voting with on-chain settlement
✓ Geographic DAO boundaries
✓ Mobile-first UX
✓ Swiss eID integration

**Technical stack:**
• React + TypeScript + Vite
• Solidity smart contracts
• Sepolia testnet (mainnet soon)
• WalletConnect integration

**The question:**
Is one-person-one-vote governance useful for the Ethereum ecosystem? Or is token-weighted voting the only viable model?

Curious about your thoughts. Happy to answer technical questions.

### r/Switzerland Post

**Title:** Building a digital democracy platform specifically for Swiss-style direct democracy

**Body:**
Hoi zäme,

I'm developing a governance platform called Nebula with native support for Swiss democracy models.

**Why Switzerland?**
Swiss direct democracy is world-leading, but participation is declining among younger citizens. We're bridging this gap with mobile-first tools.

**Swiss-specific features:**
• Swiss eID integration (in development)
• Multi-language (German, French, Italian)
• Canton/municipality geographic boundaries
• Referendum and initiative workflows
• Privacy-first (Swiss data protection compliant)

**Pilot program:**
Looking for 3-5 Swiss municipalities to pilot digital voting for:
• Participatory budgeting
• Youth council decisions
• Community consultations

**About me:**
Working with @DaveShapi on governance innovation. Platform is live on testnet.

Would your Gemeinde/Stadt benefit from digital democracy tools?

Grüezi, Nathan
