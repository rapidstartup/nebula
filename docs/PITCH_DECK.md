# Nebula Pitch Deck

## Decentralized Democratic Governance Platform

---

## Slide 1: The Problem

**Democracy is Broken**
- Citizens feel disconnected from decision-making
- Bureaucratic inefficiency kills community initiatives
- Centralized systems are vulnerable to corruption and censorship
- Young people are disengaged from traditional politics

**The Gap:** No platform exists that combines the accessibility of social media with the transparency and trustlessness of blockchain for democratic governance.

---

## Slide 2: The Solution

**Nebula: Cosmic-Powered Democratic Governance**

A decentralized platform that enables:
- ✅ **Geographic DAOs** - Location-based communities with real governance power
- ✅ **Self-Sovereign Identity** - Proof of Personhood prevents Sybil attacks
- ✅ **Transparent Voting** - On-chain verifiable elections and referendums
- ✅ **Treasury Management** - Community-controlled budgets with full transparency

**Mission:** Return democratic power to its rightful place: in the hands of the people.

---

## Slide 3: How It Works

**3-Step Participation:**

1. **Connect** - Link your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, mobile wallets)
2. **Verify** - Create self-sovereign identity with Proof of Personhood
3. **Participate** - Join DAOs, create proposals, vote on community decisions

## Slide 4: Technical Architecture

**Smart Contracts (Deployed on Sepolia Testnet):**

- **Voting** (0x9fBC...cA71) - Transparent proposal voting
- **ActionToken** (0xd30f...434e) - Governance token
- **Agents** (0xbc7E...FDc0) - Autonomous agent framework
