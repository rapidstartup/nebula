## Application Templates

### Template: Ethereum Foundation ESP

**Project Name:** Nebula - Democratic Governance Infrastructure

**Amount Requested:** $150,000

**Project Description:**
Nebula is building open-source governance infrastructure for democratic organizations. Unlike existing DAO tools that use token-weighted voting (plutocracy), Nebula enables one-person-one-vote governance with identity verification, geographic boundaries, and mobile-first design.

**Key Features:**
- Self-sovereign identity with proof of personhood
- Geographic DAOs for location-based communities
- Swiss eID integration for official use cases
- Gasless off-chain voting with on-chain verification
- Mobile-first UX for non-crypto-native users

**Why This Matters:**
Current DAO tooling excludes most democratic organizations (HOAs, cooperatives, municipalities) by requiring crypto knowledge and favoring wealthy token holders. Nebula bridges this gap, making decentralized governance accessible to everyone.

**Use of Funds:**
- Smart contract development & audit: $50,000
- Frontend development: $40,000
- Swiss eID integration: $30,000
- Pilot program support: $20,000
- Documentation & community: $10,000

**Timeline:** 6 months

**Team:**
- Nathan Shearer - Project Lead
- [Additional team members]

**Deliverables:**
1. Production-ready smart contracts (audited)
2. Complete frontend with Swiss eID integration
3. 3-5 pilot municipalities onboarded
4. Full documentation and developer guides
5. Open source codebase

**Public Good:**
All code open source (MIT license). Free for communities under 50 members. Sliding scale for larger organizations.

### Template: Polygon Village

**Project Name:** Nebula Governance Platform

**Amount Requested:** $75,000

**Project Description:**
Nebula is a governance platform enabling democratic DAOs on Polygon. We're deploying on Polygon Amoy testnet with plans for mainnet launch.

**Why Polygon:**
- Low gas costs enable frequent voting
- Fast finality for real-time results
- Growing DAO ecosystem
- Environmental alignment (PoS)

**Grant Use:**
- Polygon mainnet deployment: $20,000
- Smart contract optimization: $15,000
- Marketing to Polygon DAOs: $20,000
- Integration with Polygon ecosystem: $15,000
- Community events: $5,000

**Milestones:**
1. Amoy testnet deployment (Month 1)
2. Mainnet contracts deployed (Month 2)
3. 10 Polygon DAOs onboarded (Month 4)
4. Case studies published (Month 6)
