✓ Mobile voting (iOS, Android, web)
✓ Automatic quorum tracking
✓ Tamper-proof vote records
✓ Digital proxy voting
✓ Instant results
✓ Full audit trail

**HOA-specific features:**
- Property-based voting rights

### Subject: Democratic Governance for [Co-op Name]

```
Hello [Cooperative Leadership Team],

Cooperatives are built on democratic principles - one member, one vote. But 
traditional voting processes often exclude busy members and favor those who 
can attend meetings in person.

**What if every member could participate equally?**

Nebula is a governance platform designed for democratic organizations like yours:

**Core Features:**
• One-member-one-vote (or your chosen structure)
• Mobile and web access
• Transparent proposal and voting process
• Treasury transparency
• Member verification
• Low cost ($0.10-0.50 per member/month)

**Built for Cooperatives:**
- Membership verification
- Share/voting power tracking
- Board elections
- Bylaw amendments
- Budget approvals
- Working group coordination

**Why cooperatives choose us:**
✓ Aligns with cooperative principles
✓ Increases member engagement
✓ Reduces administrative burden
✓ Creates trust through transparency
✓ Accessible to all members

**Case Study Preview:**
A 200-member housing cooperative in [Location] increased participation from 
35% to 78% after switching to digital voting with Nebula.

Would you like to see how it works for your cooperative?
