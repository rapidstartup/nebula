### Post Templates

**Template 1: Problem/Solution (for r/DAO)**
```
Title: Most DAO tools aren't actually democratic. Here's what we're building.

The problem: Token-weighted voting means whales control everything.

The solution: Identity-verified, one-person-one-vote governance.

We built Nebula for communities that want actual democracy:
- Geographic DAOs (neighborhoods, municipalities)
- Verified identity (no Sybils, no bots)
- Gasless voting
- Swiss eID integration

Live on Sepolia testnet. Looking for pilot communities.

What features would your DAO need?
```

**Template 2: Swiss Focus (for r/Switzerland)**
```
Title: Digital democracy platform with native Swiss eID support

We're building Nebula, a governance platform specifically designed for Swiss-style direct democracy.

Features:
- Swiss eID integration
- One-person-one-vote (not token-weighted)
- Mobile-first voting
- Geographic DAO boundaries
- Multi-language (DE/EN/FR/IT)

Looking for Swiss municipalities interested in pilot programs.

Would you use digital voting for local issues?

### Outreach Template

**Subject: Podcast guest pitch - Building democratic DAOs**

```
Hi [Host Name],

I came across [Podcast Name] while researching governance-focused shows.

I'm Nathan Shearer, building Nebula - a governance platform that's actually
democratic (not token-weighted plutocracy). We're focusing on:

• 1-person-1-vote with identity verification
• Geographic DAOs (municipalities, neighborhoods)
• Swiss eID integration for official pilots
• Making DAOs accessible to non-crypto people

The platform is live on testnet and we're seeking pilot communities.

I'd love to discuss:
- Why most DAOs aren't actually democratic
- How to verify identity without doxxing
- The Swiss municipality pilot opportunity
- Governance as public infrastructure

Would you be interested in having me on the show?

Best,
Nathan Shearer
