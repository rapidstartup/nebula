## Email Template: Initial Outreach

### Subject: Digital Democracy Pilot Opportunity - [Municipality Name]

```
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,

I'm writing from Nebula, a Swiss-focused platform for digital democratic governance. 
We're seeking 3-5 forward-thinking Swiss municipalities to pilot a new approach to 
citizen participation.

**What we're offering:**
• Free pilot program (6 months)
• Digital voting and proposal systems
• Integration with Swiss eID
• Geographic DAO structure for your municipality
• Full technical support and training
• Data remains under your control

**Why now:**
Switzerland leads in direct democracy, but participation is declining among younger 
citizens. Our platform bridges this gap with mobile-first, accessible tools that 
complement traditional processes.

**Pilot scope:**
- Non-binding consultation processes
- Youth council elections/decisions
- Participatory budgeting experiments
- Community initiative management

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore whether this fits your 
digitalization roadmap?

Available times this week:

Best regards,

## Objection Handling

### "We don't have budget for this"
**Response:** The pilot is completely free. We only ask for feedback and a case study if the results are positive. Post-pilot pricing is designed to be affordable for municipalities.

### "Blockchain seems complicated/experimental"
**Response:** Users don't interact with blockchain directly - they use a simple web app. Blockchain provides transparency and auditability behind the scenes, like a digital notary. Think of it as infrastructure, not a feature users need to understand.

### "What about data privacy (DSGVO)?"
**Response:** Personal data is minimized and user-controlled. Voting records are pseudonymous. We can host in Switzerland with Swiss providers. All data can be exported or deleted at any time.

### "Our citizens aren't tech-savvy"
**Response:** The platform is designed for accessibility - simple language, clear interfaces, mobile-optimized. Start with younger demographics (youth council, digital natives) and expand based on results.

### "We already have a participation platform"
**Response:** Nebula complements existing tools with blockchain-verifiable transparency, lower costs, and Swiss eID integration. We can integrate with existing systems or run parallel pilots.

### "What if something goes wrong?"
**Response:** Pilot uses testnet (no real value at risk). All decisions are consultative initially. 24/7 technical support during pilot. Easy exit - data export anytime.
