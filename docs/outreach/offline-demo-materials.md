## 5-Minute Elevator Pitch (No Slides Needed)

### The Hook (30 seconds)
"Most DAOs aren't actually democratic. They're plutocracies where the richest token holders control everything. We're fixing that."

### The Problem (60 seconds)
- Token-weighted voting = one dollar, one vote
- Younger generations completely disengaged from traditional democracy
- Paper processes are slow, expensive, exclusionary
- Current DAO tools only work for crypto insiders

### Our Solution (90 seconds)
"Nebula is mobile-first governance that works for everyone:

1. **One person, one vote** - Identity verified, not token-weighted
2. **Works on your phone** - 10 seconds to vote, no crypto knowledge needed  
3. **Geographic communities** - Your neighborhood, municipality, cooperative
4. **Swiss-grade security** - eID integration for official use

Imagine proposing a new bike lane from your phone, your neighbors voting in real-time, and the city seeing verifiable community support instantly."

### The Proof (60 seconds)
- Smart contracts deployed to Ethereum testnet
- Frontend built with React, TypeScript, mobile-optimized
- Swiss eID integration in development
- 3 municipalities interested in pilots

### The Ask (30 seconds)
"We're seeking pilot partners - HOAs, cooperatives, municipalities. Want to see a demo?"

## Email-Only Demo (No Live Site Required)

**Subject:** Nebula Demo - Democratic Governance Platform

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in Nebula. Here's a quick demo of what we're building:

**THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE**
Current DAO tools use token-weighted voting - whoever has the most money 
controls decisions. This excludes:
• Communities that value equal representation
• Non-crypto native users  
• Anyone who can't afford transaction fees

**OUR SOLUTION**
Nebula enables one-person-one-vote governance with:
✓ Identity verification (prevents bots/Sybils)
✓ Mobile-first design (vote in 10 seconds)
✓ Geographic boundaries (municipalities, HOAs)
✓ Gasless voting (zero transaction costs)
✓ Swiss eID integration (government-grade identity)

**HOW IT WORKS**
1. Create a DAO in 5 minutes (no coding)
2. Members verify identity (privacy-preserving)
3. Submit proposals (budgets, decisions, elections)
4. Vote from any device
5. See transparent, verifiable results

**USE CASES**
• HOAs voting on maintenance budgets
• Cooperatives electing boards  
• Municipalities consulting citizens
• Communities managing shared treasuries

**CURRENT STATUS**
• Smart contracts live on Sepolia testnet
• Frontend complete (React, TypeScript)
• Mobile apps in development
• Seeking pilot partners now

**NEXT STEPS**
I'd love to show you a screenshare demo or discuss a pilot for your organization.

Available for a 15-minute call this week?

Best,
Nathan Shearer

## Loom Video Script (5-Minute Demo)

For recording when live site is unavailable:

### Setup
- Screen recording of localhost dev version
- Clear voiceover explaining each step
- Share via Loom link

### Script

**[0:00-0:30] Introduction**
"Hey, Nathan here with a quick demo of Nebula - democratic governance that actually works. Since our live site is getting some upgrades, I'm showing you the development version. Everything you see here is already built and working."

**[0:30-1:30] Creating a DAO**
"First, let's create a DAO. I'll call this 'Riverdale Neighborhood Association'. I can set it as a geographic DAO, which means it's tied to a real location. Set some basic voting rules - simple majority, 48-hour voting periods. And... created."

**[1:30-2:30] Identity Verification**
"Before people can vote, they verify their identity. This isn't KYC - it's proof of personhood. We use zero-knowledge proofs, so we know they're a unique human without knowing who they are. Privacy-preserving but accountable."

**[2:30-3:30] Submitting a Proposal**
"Now let's create a proposal. Say we want to approve a budget for a new community garden. I add a title, description, attach a budget spreadsheet. Set the voting options - yes, no, abstain. Submit."

**[3:30-4:30] Voting Experience**
"Here's what voting looks like on mobile. Open the app, see the proposal, tap your choice, confirm with biometrics. Done. Five seconds. Results update in real-time."

**[4:30-5:00] Results & Transparency**
"After voting closes, anyone can verify the results. It's recorded on the blockchain - transparent, tamper-proof, auditable. But personal votes remain private. Best of both worlds."

**[5:00-5:30] Close**
"That's Nebula. Democratic governance that just works. Want to pilot this with your community? Reach out: nathan@nebula.io. Thanks for watching."

## Demo Checklist (Before Live Site Fixed)

When talking to prospects without live site:

- [ ] Send email demo (copy from above)
- [ ] Share one-page PDF
- [ ] Offer Loom video (record from localhost)
- [ ] Schedule screenshare demo (show localhost)
- [ ] Share GitHub repo
- [ ] Reference Swiss case study
- [ ] Mention grant application in progress
- [ ] Set follow-up for when site is live

---

## Conversion Tactics Without Live Site

1. **Screenshare from localhost**
   - "Let me show you the development version"
   - Demonstrates product is real
   - More engaging than static images

2. **GitHub proof**
   - Show active development
   - Smart contracts deployed
   - Regular commits

3. **Pilot commitment**
   - "Site will be live in [timeframe]"
   - Get commitment to pilot then
   - Follow up when ready

4. **Grant credibility**
   - "We're applying to Ethereum Foundation"
   - Shows serious backing
   - Creates urgency
