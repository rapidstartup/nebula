## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Snapshot

**Strengths:**
- Gasless off-chain voting
- Wide adoption in Web3
- Simple proposal creation
- Multiple voting strategies

**Limitations:**
- No on-chain execution (requires Safe integration)
- No identity/anti-Sybil mechanisms
- Token-weighted only (no 1-person-1-vote)
- Not designed for geographic communities
- No built-in treasury management

**When to choose Snapshot:** Pure token governance where whale dominance is acceptable

**When to choose Nebula:** Need democratic equality (1-person-1-vote), geographic communities, or identity verification

---

### 2. Tally

**Strengths:**

- Governor Bravo/Compound compatibility
- Robust for DeFi protocols
- Professional interface

**Limitations:**
- Expensive (on-chain votes cost gas)
- Complex setup for non-technical users
- Token-weighted governance only
- No geographic or identity features
- Overkill for small communities

**When to choose Tally:** Large DeFi protocols with high-value on-chain decisions

**When to choose Nebula:** Cost-sensitive communities, diverse voting mechanisms, or need for verified identity

---

### 3. Aragon

**Strengths:**
- Full DAO framework
- Customizable permissions
- Long track record
- Comprehensive toolkit

**Limitations:**
- Steep learning curve
- Complex deployment
- Expensive on-chain operations
