## Grant Application Template

### Project Summary
**Title:** Nebula - Decentralized Democratic Governance Platform

**One-liner:** Mobile-first governance for DAOs and democratic organizations with verified identity and geographic boundaries.

**Problem:** Current DAO tools are complex, token-weighted, and exclude non-technical users. Traditional democratic organizations lack modern digital tools.

**Solution:** Nebula provides accessible, mobile-first governance with 1-person-1-vote verification, geographic DAOs, and Swiss eID integration.

**Impact:** Enables fair, transparent governance for HOAs, cooperatives, municipalities, and communities worldwide.

### Milestones

2. **M2:** Swiss municipality pilot launch (Month 2-3)
3. **M3:** Mobile app release (Month 3-4)
4. **M4:** 10 pilot DAOs active (Month 4-6)
5. **M5:** Public launch and scaling (Month 6-12)

### Budget

| Development | 60% | Smart contracts, mobile apps, security |
