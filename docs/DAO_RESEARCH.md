4. Offer free pilot with technical support

### Phase 2: Community Orgs (Months 3-6)
1. Target university student governments (start of semester)
2. Partner with housing cooperative associations
3. Engage climate groups at events

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 6-12)
1. Case studies from successful pilots
2. Conference presentations (WebSummit, ETHDenver, etc.)

## Key Messages by Audience

### For Governments:
"Increase citizen participation while maintaining security and transparency."

### For Communities:
"Make decisions together with tools that can't be corrupted or censored."

### For Developers:
"Build on a platform that puts UX first without compromising decentralization."

## Competitive Positioning

### Against Traditional Civic Tech (e.g., Decidim, Consul):
- ✅ True decentralization (not just open source)
- ✅ Censorship resistant
- ✅ Tokenized incentives possible
- ⚠️ Less feature-complete (for now)

### Against Crypto DAOs (e.g., Aragon, Snapshot):
- ✅ Better UX for non-technical users
- ✅ Geographic/identity focus
- ✅ Mobile-first
- ⚠️ Less established brand

**Nebula's Sweet Spot:** Organizations that want crypto-level security with consumer-app usability.

## Success Metrics for Pilots

1. **Adoption:** Number of users onboarded
2. **Engagement:** Proposals created, votes cast
3. **Retention:** Return users over 3 months
4. **Satisfaction:** User surveys (target: 8/10)
5. **Outcomes:** Decisions actually implemented

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Create personalized outreach emails for Zug and Geneva
2. **Week 1:** Attend local Swiss tech/governance meetup
3. **Week 2:** Publish case study blog post (even hypothetical)
4. **Month 1:** Schedule 5 pilot conversations
5. **Month 2:** Close first paying customer or grant
