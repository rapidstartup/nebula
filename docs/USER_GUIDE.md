## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds" error
- You need Sepolia ETH for gas fees
- Get free testnet ETH from [sepoliafaucet.com](https://sepoliafaucet.com)

### Wallet won't connect
- Ensure you're on Sepolia testnet (not Ethereum mainnet)
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check that your wallet is unlocked

### Transaction pending too long
- Check network congestion on [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io)
- You may need to increase gas price for faster confirmation

### Can't see my DAO
- Make sure you're connected with the same wallet that created it
- Check the DAO address is correct
- Try refreshing the page

## Security Tips

- Never share your private key or seed phrase
- Always verify contract addresses before signing
- Start with small test transactions
- Use a hardware wallet for large amounts
